## 📊 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive risk and performance assessment of U.S. banking institutions from 2020–2024, using SEC regulatory filings as the primary data source. The analysis evaluates whether the industry's post-pandemic expansion was sustainable—or structurally fragile.

### Key Question
**Were banks growing stronger, or simply growing larger?**

## 💡 Why I Built This Project

This project was born from a critical observation: **balance sheet growth is often celebrated without sufficient scrutiny of the quality and sustainability of that growth.**

### **The Motivation**

During the 2020–2024 period, U.S. banks experienced unprecedented expansion driven by:
- Post-pandemic liquidity surges
- Historically accommodative monetary policy
- Federal Reserve intervention at a scale never before seen

While headlines celebrated record asset growth, I wanted to answer deeper questions:
- Was this expansion built on solid fundamentals or temporary conditions?
- Were profitability and efficiency keeping pace with balance sheet size?
- What risks were accumulating beneath the surface?

### **The Challenge**

Traditional financial reporting often:
- Focuses on backward-looking metrics
- Emphasizes growth without contextualizing quality
- Obscures early warning signals through aggregated data
- Lacks integrated risk and performance perspectives

I wanted to create an analysis that **moves beyond compliance reporting** to deliver **strategic intelligence**.

### **The Vision**

This project demonstrates how:
- **Data-driven accounting** can identify risk before it becomes crisis
- **Integrated analysis** reveals patterns invisible in isolated metrics
- **Forensic methodology** transforms regulatory filings into strategic insights
- **Transparent documentation** enables reproducibility and peer review

### **Personal Goals**

As a professional passionate about financial analysis and risk management, I built this project to:

1. **Bridge Theory and Practice:** Apply academic concepts to real-world regulatory data
2. **Demonstrate Technical Proficiency:** Showcase end-to-end data engineering and analysis skills
3. **Create Actionable Intelligence:** Deliver insights that inform actual business decisions
4. **Contribute to Financial Literacy:** Share methodology that others can learn from and build upon
5. **Challenge Conventional Narratives:** Question whether bigger always means better

### **The Broader Impact**

This project serves as a blueprint for how financial professionals can:
- Leverage public data for independent analysis
- Identify structural vulnerabilities before market consensus
- Communicate complex findings to non-technical stakeholders
- Build repeatable, scalable analytical frameworks

**Ultimately, this project exists because sustainable growth requires not just expansion, but disciplined profitability, operational efficiency, and proactive risk governance.**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess balance sheet growth sustainability across volatile market conditions
- Evaluate profitability trends and capital efficiency metrics
- Identify emerging risk indicators through leverage and earnings analysis
- Provide actionable intelligence for risk management and strategic decision-making

## 🔍 Methodology

### Data Sources
- **SEC EDGAR 10-K Filings** (Q4 annual data, 2020–2024)
- **XBRL-tagged numeric disclosures** for precision and consistency
- **Banking institutions** identified via SIC codes 6000–6199

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Data extraction, normalization, validation
- **Excel:** Financial modeling, YoY analysis, executive reporting
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboard and data visualization
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, `sec-edgar-downloader`

### Key Metrics Analyzed
- Total Assets
- Net Income
- Return on Assets (ROA)
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Leverage Ratio
- Year-over-Year growth indicators

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### Balance Sheet Expansion
- **Explosive growth** (2020–2023) driven by post-pandemic liquidity
- **Sharp deceleration** (2024) indicating strategic contraction

### Earnings Volatility
- Net income exhibited **high volatility** with inconsistent recovery
- Profitability **failed to scale** with asset growth

### Profitability Metrics
- **ROA and ROE declined progressively** over the period
- Shift from efficiency-driven to volume-driven growth

### Leverage Dynamics
- **Elevated leverage** during expansion amplified earnings volatility
- **Stabilization in 2024** signals industry-wide de-risking

### Overall Assessment
> *"Balance sheet growth introduced structural fragility as efficiency deteriorated and earnings instability intensified. The industry expanded into risk, not away from it."*
